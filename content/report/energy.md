## Energy, the environment, and the Guatemalan economy in a nutshell


Nature provides the Guatemalan economy with coal, wind, power derived from water and thermal sources, fuelwood, sugar cane bagasse, and crude oil, among others. These are called "primary sources" of energy because they are usable in their natural form to some extent. We can take advantage of them locally or we can import them from the rest of the world. However, most of the economy's productive processes cannot take advantage of these sources in their raw form, and so they are transformed into what we call secondary sources of energy. Examples of this type of energy include the various types of gasolines and diesel fuels, liquefied petroleum gas, and electricity.

Different industries, or economic activities, use both primary and secondary energy sources as inputs in their production processes. Households, in turn, use them to satisfy domestic needs like cooking, powering of devices, heating or cooling, among others. One special industry uses large amounts of various types of primary and secondary sources to produce electricity, which is then used universally by everyone else in the economy.

Finally, from the combustion&mdash;or simply burning&mdash;of some these energy products, industries emit various gases that go up into the atmosphere. Some of these are known as greenhouse gases and in our accounting efforts we have tracked carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). 



## How does energy flow from the environment to the economy?

Between 2001 and 2006, the Guatemalan economy used several types of energy resources directly from the environment in order to satisfy both the needs of industries and households. Water's potential energy and thermal energy from volcanic activity were key resources in the production of electricity. The country also extracted crude oil and natural gas in some regions, which were destined almost exclusively for the export market. Guatemalans also imported coal from other countries mainly for the production of electricity. Nevertheless, in Guatemala the biggest source of energy obtained directly from the environment was biomass in the form of fuelwood for domestic use and sugarcane bagasse, mainly used as an input in the production of electricity.

The table below shows the relative structure of energy sources that were used directly from nature in Guatemala in terajoules (TJ) between 2001 and 2006. This is called primary energy. It is evident that biomass was extremely important for the country, with a use share of around 83% of all primary energy sources. And within that category fuelwood powered household activities with 224,227.3 TJ or 90% of that biomass. The second most important source of primary energy was coal, which was used mainly for the production of electricity and was mostly imported. Hydraulic and geothermal energy were also important for the country with around 20,534 TJ used in the year 2006. Even if oil production in the country was important as a source of foreign income, its direct use in Guatemala was minimal, with a share of about 1% of primary resources.

## How does energy move within the economy?

A total of 483,947.3 TJ[^8] of energy in all its forms was available to the Guatemalan economy in 2006. That energy was used as inputs in the production of goods and services by several industries, and also by households, the government, and non-profit institutions in processes such as cooking, artificial lighting, heating, or cooling.

[^8]: Some of this energy was produced locally and a portion was imported.

The figure shows quantities of energy in terajoules used by the different economic industries and households in the rows, coming from the various energy sources in the columns. Darker tones represent higher uses of energy relative to total consumption. According to this, household final consumption of represented around 47% of total use and even surpassed slightly all consumption of energy used as inputs in production processes (46%). This was due not only to the fact that households were the main users of fuelwood (which has a high calorific content), but also of gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas for cooking, and electricity.

The largest user of energy of all types in the Guatemalan economy was by far the production and distribution of electricity with a total of 61,594 TJ, equivalent to 27% of the energy used by industries as inputs in 2006. This meant that the Guatemalan society used a large percentage of energy of different kinds (such as coal, bunker, diesel, bagasse, etc.), which in many cases was imported at high costs, to produce electricity.

## What happens with Greenhouse Gas Emissions?

The total human contribution to greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of different energy sources in Guatemala amounted to 45.6 million carbon dioxide metric tons equivalent in 2006. In general terms, that was less than 1% of total world emissions. Nevertheless, since it is such an important topic in general terms, it could still carry financial consequences or opportunities regarding international treaties on the matter and we need to track its performance. Table 11 shows the distribution of emissions among groups of economic industries.

The figure below shows the greenhouse gas emissions of the top five emitting industries on the left of the vertical axis with bars and those of households on the right of the vertical axis with a line. Households emissions were considerably higher, due to the high carbon content of fuelwood and their large use of that product, coupled with their considerable use of gasoline. Among the top emitters, it is interesting to note that the emissions of the production and distribution of electricity more than doubled those of the industry that follows it. This was consistent with the high use of fossil fuels in the production of electricity.

<hr>

The second industry on the graph is the production of bread which is there because of its high use of fuelwood. In a GHG inventory (those advocated by the Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change) emissions from biomass do not count toward the total emissions and are left as "memorandum items", this in order to avoid double counting. In the supply and use accounting structure of the SEEA, this is not a problem, and hence they were included. If fuelwood and bagasse were excluded, bakeries and mills would exit this list and cement production and retail trade would replace them. Finally, due to its high use of different fuels, the transportation industry was also important in this context.

## With what intensity is energy used by industries?

Figure 5 shows an indicator called energy intensity for six economic industries for 2001-2006. Due to the nature of each type of economic activity, we can find these at different general levels of intensity. Some industries needed less energy to produce one unit of wealth added to the economy in that year (value added), like retail trade for example, and others, like cement production needed considerably more. For that reason it is not altogether adequate to compare intensities between industries. However, it is possible to compare how a specific industry fares through time. In that way, we can see if use of energy per unit of newly added wealth has improved or become worse.

<hr>

In the case of Guatemala, the production of bread showed a decrease in its intensity in the period. The production of ceramics showed a more erratic behavior, but mantained its high level of energy use, whereas transportation and general mills had a more stable energy intensity over time. This is probably due to the fact that technology is replaced less often in those activities.

## How is energy supplied to the economy?

We divide the energy supply for Guatemala into eleven groups of products, which in turn can be divided into primary and secondary energy sources. These are shown in Table 1, where the largest supply of energy corresponds to fuelwood in caloric terms (about 46% of all energy use). The supply of refined products from oil represented around 30%, which came mostly from imports. Coal was imported in its entirety. Primary sources were the largest component, with 73% of total supply in 2001 and 65% in 2006.

**[Table 1, p.16, AD, Energy supply by energy commodity]**

It is important to note that table 2 shows that between 28% and 36% of total energy came from imports between 2001 and 2006, while the energy produced domestically saw its share reduced from 73% to 64% during the analysis period. This is consistent with a reduction of oil production in the country and an increase in relative terms of oil refined products.

**[Table 2, p. 17, AD, Energy supply by groups of economic activity]**

In monetary terms, the importance between primary and secondary sources was reversed, due to the higher unit price of electricity and imported refined products from oil when compared with fuelwood or bagasse. Secondary sources, in this case, represented 77% of all energy transactions in the economy in 2001 and 84% in 2006 (see table 3). Bagasse, which is a by product of the sugar cane milling process, was not valued in monetary terms.

**[Table 3, p.18, AD, Monetary supply]**

## How is energy used in Guatemala?

Conceptually, energy use must be equal to its supply, and that means that the energy produced in the country must be used in its entirety by economic agents, either by industries, in final consumption, or as exports. The ability to disaggregate energy use by type of economic activity is one of the advantages of an energy account, because it allows us to track the economy's energetic performance, but also the energy consumption of its individual agents.

Guatemala consumed an average of 45,299.8 terajoules of energy in all its forms during 2001-2006 and the largest consumers of energy were households with a use of around 51% of available energy in 2001, and about 46% in 2006, especially for their use of fuelwood (see table 4).

**[Table 4, p.20, AD, Energy use in monetary terms]**

During that time, the group of economic activities labelled as manufactures consumed an average of 20% of the available energy annually, while the single utility sector of the economy in charge of the production of electricity consumed also an average of 20% of energy in all of its forms. The transportation sector, which is the largest user of diesel fuel in the country, became a distant fourth in this list. Overall, exports as a use category decreased in relative terms from representing 11% of total energy use in 2001 to 7% in 2006.

In monetary terms, the use of energy had a different behavior (see table 5). For example, in contrast with their use in calorific terms, their use in monetary terms was of approximately 29% of total energy use between 2001 and 2006. This is largely due to the fact that their largest energy input comes in the form of fuelwood, which has a lower value per unit than other energy types, and a large share comes from self extraction, not purchases. 

**[Table 5, p.21, AD, Energy use in monetary terms]**

The list of largest consumers of energy commodities in monetary terms is headed by manufactures with an average of 22% annual use of the total energy available, followed by wholesale and retail trade with 10%. It is also interesting that in monetary terms, exports become more important, with about 9% of annual use in the 2001-2006 period.

## Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

Once we established the use of energy by the different economic activities of Guatemala, a further step allowed us to estimate the greenhouse gasses that were emitted to the atmosphere as a result of the combustion of energy products.

Table 6 shows these emissions both in metric tons, as well as in a unit which makes nitrous oxide and methane emissions equivalent to those of carbon dioxide. Given the high carbon content in fuelwood and its generalized use in Guatemala, households top the list of emitters with a responsibility of about 60% of all emissions in carbon dioxide tons equivalent in 2006 (over a 20 year horizon). Manufactures were responsible for about 18% and the group labeled Utilities, where the production and distribution of electricity is included, was responsible for close to 13% of total emissions in that same year.

## Energy Supply and Use tables

It was possible to construct for every year in the study a supply and use table with the information shown so far. These types of tables give us an overall view of energy flows for the entire country. The columns in this case show the different energy products, either offered by any of the economic activities in the rows, or used by them. Table 7 shows this in terajoules for 2006.

**[Table 7, p. 24, AD, Supply and Use Tables for 2006 in terajoules]**

## Additional Indicators

The information on flows allowed us to construct an indicator showing the intensity with which energy is used. This indicator measures how much energy is necessary to generate one unit of value added or newly generated wealth in that year. We saw some insights using this indicator in the discussion on energy intensity.

We also computed the decoupling indicator, a measure that measures the gap between the growth rate of energy consumption and the growth rate of the economy. In an ideal situation, the economy would grow steadily, while the consumption of energy would decrease over time. This would mean that the country would be so efficient with its resources that it could produce more each year with the same consumption of energy as in the previous year, or have the same production, but with less energy. On an aggregate basis, the Guatemalan economy showed a clear example of decoupling where the economy grew at a much more rapid pace than that of its energy demand.

## Summary

In this essay, we have introduced the Energy and Emissions Account of Guatemala. This account is a framework that allows us to understand the intricate relationship between the environment and the economy in terms of energy resources, and at the same time quantify the emissions that result from the combustion of the different types of energy.

In the last year of the analysis, there was an energy consumption of 483,947 terajoules.

Around 46% of all the energy consumed can be attributed to household final use, where fuelwood, gasoline, and electricity are predominant.

The production of electricity used about 13% of all energy consumption, equivalent to 61,594 TJ. 

Among the relevant players in the consumption of energy we found the production of bakery products (3.6% of total use), transportation (3.5%), grain milling (3.3%), cement production (2.6%), wholesale and retail trade (2.2%), restaurants and bars (1.1%), sugar milling (1%), and the production of soaps and detergents (1%).

From the combustion of energy, a total of 45.6 million CO<sub>2</sub> tons equivalent were emitted to the atmosphere, of which the 5 largest emitters (excluding households) were responsible for 11.6 million CO<sub>2</sub> tons equivalent or 64%. Households emitted around 27.5 million CO<sub>2</sub> tons equivalent.

In terms of intensity, a measure that compares energy use with value added generation, we have that the electricity generation industry requires 14.2 terajoules for every million quetzales (GTQ) that it contributes to GDP, which contrasts with the average for manufactures (2.9 TJ for every million GTQ), or trade activities that circle below 1 TJ for every million GTQ of value added.
